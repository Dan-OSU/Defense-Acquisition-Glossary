Regardless, the Congress only appropriates Budget Authority (BA) on an annual basis."
 BPA,Blanket Purchase Agreement,"A simplified acquisition method that government agencies use to fill anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services. BPAs are negotiated on an individual agency level, and generally only a small number of agency offices can place orders on them. One advantage of traditional BPAs is that a buyer can use them to acquire a full range of services under one BPA, rather than having to purchase through multiple contracts. The BPA establishes a contractual relationship between the government and vendors who have been awarded a contract under the BPA. Tasks are then competed under the BPA contract without issuing a new contract."

,Brassboard,"An experimental or demonstration test model, intended for field testing outside the laboratory environment. A brassboard follows an earlier prototyping stage called a breadboard. A brassboard contains both the functionality and approximate physical configuration of the final operational product. Unlike breadboards, brassboards typically recreate geometric and dimensional constraints of the final system which are critical to its performance, as is the case in radio frequency systems. While representative of the physical layout of the production-grade product, a brassboard will not necessarily incorporate all final details, nor represent the physical size and quality level of the final deliverable product."
,Breadboard,"A term coined in the 1970s. It refers to an experimental device, actually a thin plastic board, used in prototyping electronic circuits where components such as integrated circuits, transistors and resistors are ""plugged"" into the board. Because a breadboard does not require soldering, it makes for easy use in creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design in the laboratory.

,Rights in Technical Data,"The right for the government to acquire TD. If the government has funded or will fund a part of or the entire development of the item, component or process, then the government is entitled to unlimited rights in the TD. However, if the above is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively at private expense, the government is entitled to limited rights. Such data must be unpublished and identified as limited rights data."
,Risk,"Potential future event or condition that may have a negative effect on achieving program objectives for cost, schedule, and performance. Defined by 1) the probability (greater than 0, less than 1) of an undesired event or condition, and 2) the consequences, impact or severity of the undesired event, were it to occur."
,Risk Acceptance,A risk mitigation option where the program acknowledges that the risk event or condition may be realized and willingly accepts the risk with its consequences. Accepting a risk does not mean it is being ignored. It should continue to be tracked through continuous monitoring to ensure the accepted consequences do not change for the worse or the likelihood increase. Monitoring implies the program establishes knowledge points that provide opportunities to reevaluate the risk.
,Risk Analysis,"Answers the questions, “What are the likelihood and consequence of the risk? And “How high is the risk?” Risk analysis provides an estimate of each risk's likelihood and consequence, and the resulting risk level to more effectively manage risks and prioritize risk mitigation efforts. The risk level is noted in the Risk Reporting Format adopted by the program."
,Risk Assumption,A risk-handling option in which selected program risks are accepted and monitored by the management team.
,Risk Avoidance,A risk mitigation option where the program reduces or eliminates the risk event or condition by taking an alternate path. It eliminates the source of the risk and replaces it with another solution. Examples are changing operating procedures or using a low-risk mature technology.
,Risk Burn-Down,"A technique typically using charts to track actual progress against planned reduction of risk levels that is part of risk monitoring. Risk burn-down is portrayed in a chart that is a snapshot of the progress of mitigating the risk over time and the effectiveness of previous risk mitigation activity. Charts show the relationship of risk mitigation activities, plotting risk level versus time to estimate their relative risk reduction contribution."
,Risk Burn-Down Plan,Included as part of the Risk Mitigation Plan covering all mitigation options where the program identifies activities to manage risks. It documents the risk burn-down approach and typically consists of time-phased activities with specific success criteria that allow the program to track “progress to plan” to reduce designated risks to an acceptable level or to closure.
,Risk Consequences,"Each risk should be evaluated in terms of impact to the program (i.e., effect of the event on program cost, schedule, and performance) should the risk be fully realized. Risk consequence is measured as a deviation against program cost, schedule, and performance baselines."
,Risk Control,A risk mitigation option that seeks to actively reduce risk to an acceptable level. It entails taking action to reduce the likelihood or consequence of a risk to as low as possible to minimize potential program impacts.
,Risk Identification,"The second step in the risk management process, which attempts to identify risks by answering the questions, ""What can go wrong?"" or “What is uniquely hard or difficult?” This involves examining the program to determine risk events and associated cause(s) that may have negative cost, schedule, and/or performance impacts."
,Risk Likelihood,The evaluated probability an event will occur given existing conditions. The estimated likelihood of the risk should be tied to a specific well-defined risk event or condition and risk statement.
,Risk Management,"A five step management process that may be applied to a discrete risk to plan, identify, analyze, mitigate/correct, and monitor the program risk. It is broadly applicable to multiple phases in the program life cycle, but the details of particular actions will vary depending on program phase."

The RMF has six steps: categorize system, select security controls, implement security controls, assess security controls, authorize system, and monitor security controls. 2. A structured approach used to oversee and manage risk for an enterprise."
 RMP,Risk Management Plan,"A document that describes a program's risk management approach and activities. (Note: some programs document their plans in a combined Risk, Issue, and Opportunity (RIO) Management Plan. Others document their plans in separate documents, that is, separate Risk Management, Issue Management and Opportunity Plans.) Now called the Program Risk Process (PRP) Document in the source noted below."
,Risk Management Process Model,"Includes the following key activities: risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation planning, risk mitigation plan implementation, and risk tracking."

,Risk Mitigation,"Methodology used by the DoD to manage risk. Provides the substantive steps a program will take to mitigate its actual risks that are initially summarized in the program's Acquisition Strategy and updated as risks are identified and managed. It includes the options or combination of options and the specific implementation approach. It answers the question, ""What is the plan to address the risk? or ""Should the risk be accepted, avoided, transferred, or controlled?"""
,Risk Mitigation Plan Implementation,The activity of executing the Risk Mitigation Plan to ensure successful risk mitigation occurs.
,Risk Mitigation Planning,"The activity that identifies, evaluates, and selects options to set risk at acceptable levels given program constraints and objectives.

Risk mitigation options include: avoidance, control, transfer, and assumption."
,Risk Mitigation Plans,"Documents the risk mitigation strategy, including the risk mitigation options or combinations of options, and specific implementation approach for mitigating each risk. High risks, and typically moderate risks, have resourced Risk Mitigation Plans. Risk Mitigation Plans should include a Risk Burn-Down Plan for high, moderate, and selected low risks."
,Risk Mitigation Strategy,"Includes the risk mitigation options or combination of options and the specific implementation approach for each option. It answers the questions “What is the plan to address the risk? Or “Should the risk be accepted, avoided, transferred, or controlled?” After analyzing risks, program personnel should develop a strategy to manage each risk by evaluating the risk mitigation options (Risk Acceptance, Risk Avoidance, Risk Transfer, and Risk Control) and choosing the best option or hybrid of options based on risk analysis, prioritization, and potential for risk reduction."
,Risk Monitoring,"Answers the questions, “How has the risk changed?” or “How are the risk mitigation plans working?” or ""Based on Results, should additional actions be taken to mitigate the risk?"" It is a continuous process to systematically track and evaluate the performance of risk mitigation plans against established metrics throughout the acquisition process. It is performed as part of technical reviews, Risk Management Board and Risk Working Group meetings, and program reviews using a risk management tool. The program should establish an effective means to display the current risk status and burn-down progress. The risk reporting format adopted should summarize the top program risks at Program Management Reviews or other meetings with stakeholders or senior leaders. Risk burn-down charts are one method to monitor risks."
,Risk Process Planning,"The first step in the risk management process that answers the question, “What are the program's risk and issue management processes?” It consists of the activities to develop, implement, and document steps the program will take to mitigate individual risks. The Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) should summarize the process. If a program develops a Program Risk Process (PRP) document that describes the process in more detail, the program can refer to the PRP in the SEP. The PRP outlines each of the risk management process steps (Risk Planning, Risk Identification, Risk Analysis, Risk Mitigation, and Risk Monitoring). The PRP should address the program's risk, management organization, ground rules and assumptions, candidate risk categories, and use of any risk management tools."
,Risk Register,"A tool commonly used as a central repository for all risks identified by the program team and approved by the Risk Management Board (RMB). It includes information for each risk such as risk category, risk statement, likelihood, consequence, planned mitigation measures, the risk owner, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)/Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) linkage and, where applicable expected closure dates and documentation of changes. Programs may consider combining the risk, issue, and opportunity registers into a single register."
,Risk Statement,"A key aspect of Risk Identification. It contains two elements: the potential event and the associated consequences. Risk statements should be written to define the potential event that could adversely affect the ability of the program to meet cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The recommended format is “if-then.” “If” characterizes the possible event or condition, and “then” describes the consequence or outcome."
,Risk Tracking,"The activity of systematically tracking and evaluating the performance of risk mitigation actions against established metrics throughout the acquisition process; also includes the development of further risk mitigation options or the execution of risk mitigation plans, as appropriate."
,Risk Transfer,"A risk mitigation option that reassigns or delegates the responsibility for tasks to mitigate a risk to another entity. This approach may involve reallocating risk management tasks from one program to another, between government organizations, or across sides of an interface managed by the same organization. The same risk may be carried (shared) by multiple government organizations. Programs should recognize transference of risk does not eliminate all responsibility and risk must be monitored for potential consequences. Development of government-furnished equipment for application to multiple programs typifies this type of risk."
,Robust Design,"The design of a system such that its performance is insensitive to variations in manufacturing tolerances, or its operational environment (including maintenance, transportation, and storage), or to component drift as a result of aging."

,Weapons Systems,Items that can be used directly by the Armed Forces to carry out combat missions.
,Weighted Guidelines,"A government technique for developing fee and profit negotiation objectives, within percentage ranges established by regulation."
,Wholesale Price Index (WPI),"Measurement of change in the overall price of goods before they are sold at retail. This includes the prices charged by manufacturers and, often outside the U.S., wholesalers. Usually expressed in terms of the percentage change from the prior month or a year earlier."
,Will Cost Estimate,Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCEs) of what an acquisition program will cost based upon reasonable extrapolations from historical experience and other recognized cost estimating techniques to support budgeting and programming.
,Win-Win,"A philosophy whereby all parties in a defense acquisition scenario gain some or most of what they want (i.e., everyone “wins” something, even though it may not be 100 percent of the goal); the ideal outcome."
,Withdrawal,"The action taken by a participant in a joint or international acquisition program to remove its resources (personnel and funds) before the program is completed. The transfer of the unobligated balance from an expired annual or multiple-year appropriation to the surplus account of the U.S. Treasury's general fund, or, if appropriate, to the special fund or trust fund from which derived."
,Wooden Round,"A munitions item designed specifically to require little or no maintenance, inspection, or testing throughout the life cycle. A wooden round has a predictable and acceptable level of reliability over its shelf life. Periodic assessment of a statistical sample is normally required to confirm shelf life, reliability, and capability predictions. At the end of its shelf life, a wooden round is de-militarized unless it is modified or its shelf life is extended based upon the results of stockpile reliability assessments."
,Work Aid,"A device such as a pattern, template, or sketch used to enhance a worker's ability to learn and perform a task efficiently."
 WBS,Work Breakdown Structure,"A product-oriented family tree composed of hardware, software, services, data, and facilities. The family tree results from systems engineering efforts during the acquisition of a defense materiel item."
,Work Cycle,A pattern of motions and/or processes that is repeated with negligible variation each time an operation is performed.
,Work Measurement (Labor Standards),A method to determine how long it should take an employee to perform the work and to identify opportunities for improvement.
,Work Package Budgets,"Resources that are formally assigned by the contractor to accomplish a work package expressed in dollars, hours, standards, or other definitive units."
 WP,Work Package(s),"Natural subdivision of a control account. A work package is simply a task/activity or grouping of work and is the point at which work is planned, progress is measured, and earned value is computed. It can be translated into different terms in different companies and functions. It can be a design job, a tool design package, a build-to-package, a shop order, a part number, a purchase order, or any other definable task/activity at whatever level of control is normal for program management within the company."
,Work Packages,"Natural subdivision of control accounts. A WP is simply a task/activity or grouping of work. A WP is the point at which work is planned, progress is measured, and earned value is computed."
,Work Performed,Includes completed work packages and the completed portion of work packages begun and not yet completed.
,Work Sampling Study,A statistical sampling technique employed to determine the proportion of delays or other classifications of activity present in the total work cycle.
,Workaround,A procedure developed for taking into account shortcomings or other problems in a program and devising workable solutions to get around the problems.
 WCF,Working Capital Fund,Revolving funds within DoD that finance organizations that are intended to operate like commercial businesses. WCF business units finance their operations with cash from the revolving fund; the revolving fund is then replenished by payments from the business units' customers.
 WIPT,Working-Level Integrated Product Team,"Team of representatives from all appropriate functional disciplines working together to build successful and balanced programs, identify and resolve issues, and make sound and timely decisions. WIPTs are usually chaired by the Program Manager (PM), or the PMs representative, and are advisory bodies to the PM. Direct coordination between the Program Office (PO) and all levels in the acquisition oversight and review process is expected as a means of exchanging information and building trust. Acquisition Category (ACAT) I programs normally establish, at a minimum, a Cost Performance Integrated Product Team (CPIPT) and a Test and Evaluation (T&E) WIPT. Industry representation on WIPTs, consistent with statute and at the appropriate time, may also be considered."
,Workload Estimate,"1.) The amount of work in terms of predetermined work units that organizations or individuals perform or are responsible for performing. 2.) A quantitative expression of human tasks, usually identified as standard hours of work or a corresponding number of units."
,Worst-Case Scenario,"In planning, to examine the worst possible environment or outcome and evaluate results around which to formulate next step."
,Worth,"The measure of value received for the resources expended. It is directly proportional to the cost to a foe (damage, neutralization, deception, and/or counteraction) and indirectly proportional to the system cost."
,Yockey Waiver,"An exception to the Pre-Operational Test and Evaluation Sales Policy, approved by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Weapons Division (IOPS/WPN) and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S), enabling foreign military sales or direct commercial sales of major defense equipment prior to the completion (successful or otherwise) of the operational test and evaluations."
 ZT,Zero Trust (ZT),"Evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. At its core, zero trust assumes no implicit trust is granted to assets or users based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the Internet) or asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned)."
